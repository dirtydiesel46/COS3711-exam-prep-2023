## Signals and Slots

Signals and slots are used for communication between objects. A signal is emitted when a particular event occurs, and a slot is a function that is called in response to a particular signal. The `QObject::connect()` function is used to connect a signal to a slot so that the slot is called when the signal is emitted.


Here's a simple example demonstrating the use of signal, slot, and `connect()` in Qt 6:

```cpp
#include <QCoreApplication>
#include <QObject>
#include <QDebug>

class Person : public QObject {
    Q_OBJECT

public:
    explicit Person(QString name, QObject *parent = nullptr) : QObject(parent), m_name(name) {}

    void doSomething() {
        qDebug() << m_name << "is doing something.";
        emit somethingHappened();
    }

signals:
    void somethingHappened();

private:
    QString m_name;
};

class Response : public QObject {
    Q_OBJECT

public slots:
    void react() {
        qDebug() << "Reaction to something happening received!";
    }
};

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    QCoreApplication a(argc, argv);

    Person john("John");
    Response response;

    QObject::connect(&john, &Person::somethingHappened, &response, &Response::react);

    john.doSomething();  // This will also call response.react()

    return a.exec();
}
```

Here's what this code does:

1. We define a `Person` class that inherits from `QObject`. We declare a `somethingHappened()` signal in it.
2. We have a `Response` class with a slot called `react()`.
3. In the `main()` function, we create a `Person` object and a `Response` object.
4. We connect the `somethingHappened()` signal from the `Person` object to the `react()` slot on the `Response` object using `QObject::connect()`.
5. When we call `john.doSomething()`, it emits the `somethingHappened()` signal, causing `response.react()` to be called.
