### Abstract Factory Pattern in the Note-Taking App

1. **Defined Product Interface**: Created a `TextOutputMode` interface with a method `formatText()` for formatting text in different styles.

2. **Implemented Concrete Products**: Created two concrete classes, `NormalMode` and `AllCapsMode`, that implement the `TextOutputMode` interface. Each has a different implementation for `formatText()`.

3. **Defined Factory Interface**: Created a `TextModeFactory` interface with a method `getTextOutputMode()` to produce `TextOutputMode` objects.

4. **Implemented Concrete Factories**: Developed two concrete factories, `NormalModeFactory` and `AllCapsModeFactory`, that implement the `TextModeFactory` interface. Each factory produces a different type of `TextOutputMode` object.

5. **Integrated with Logger**: Modified the `Logger` Singleton class to accept a `TextModeFactory` object and use it to format log messages. The `Logger` class uses the factory to create a `TextOutputMode` object, which it then uses to format text before logging.

6. **Dynamic Switching**: Demonstrated the ability to switch between different text output modes dynamically by changing the factory object in the `Logger`.

7. **Tested Functionality**: Successfully tested the Abstract Factory implementation by logging messages in both "Normal Mode" and "All CAPS Mode".

By following these steps, we've successfully implemented the Abstract Factory pattern to manage different text output modes in the application. This allows for easy extension and high cohesion between related objects, like different types of text formatting.
